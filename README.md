# Data Visualization With Python

In this repo, will explore various data visualization libraries in Python to create insightful and visually appealing visualizations.

## Overview
Data visualization plays a critical role in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by effectively visualizing data, we can gain insights, identify patterns, distributions, relationships within the data and communicate findings more efficiently. 

Python offers several libraries for data visualization, each with its unique capabilities and use cases. 

- **Pandas Visualization :** A popular data manipulation library in Python, provides built-in functionality for basic data visualization to quickly generate simple plots directly from Pandas DataFrames and Series without needing to import additional libraries. 

- **Matplotlib :** It is highly customizable and can create simple and complex graphs with relatively easy syntax. It's great for static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

- **Seaborn :** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn simplifies the creation of beautiful and informative statistical graphics. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics and works well with Pandas data structures.


In this repository, we will delve into different Python libraries for data visualization.
